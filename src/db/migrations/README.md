# Database Migrations

This directory contains SQL migration files for the database.

## File Naming Convention

Migration files should be named using the following format:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.sql
```

For example:
```
20230101_120000_create_users_table.sql
```

This ensures that migrations are executed in chronological order.
